The full solution of creating multiple images, preparing them for creation of model, creating the model to predict an object on the given image.

imagecreation.py it uses Stable diffusion from Hugging Face to create AI images later used for model creation.

createmodel.py it creates a model using SimpleCNN. It uses created images to train and validate the model.

prediction.py it loads former created model and uses it to classify images.

best model.pth was trained on 3 types of animals: horses, dogs and lions, with 1000 images for each type..
